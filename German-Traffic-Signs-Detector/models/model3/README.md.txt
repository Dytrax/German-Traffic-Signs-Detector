Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of Neural Networks 
that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification.
LeNet was one of the very first convolutional neural networks which helped propel 
the field of Deep Learning. This pioneering work by 
Yann LeCun was named LeNet5 after many previous successful iterations since the year 1988.
