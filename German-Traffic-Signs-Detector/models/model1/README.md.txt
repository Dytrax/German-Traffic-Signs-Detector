This model represent a machine learning classification using the library Scikik-Learn that is used to predict 
the probability of a observation. The model was train with the 80% of the data and the 20%left was used to evaluate the model
the accuracity of the model in this implementation was round 90% .
Previus of the training the code preprocces all the data to obtain better result, because the quality of tha image its not good.
